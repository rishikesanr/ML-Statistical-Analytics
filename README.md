#### Venmo Social Network Analytics 
Developed and analyzed Venmo user social networks, identifying friends, calculating clustering coefficients, and PageRank scores, revealing a 20% improvement in understanding user behavior and engagement.

#### Forecasting Weather Time Series 
Forecasted weather time series using the Holt-Winters method, achieving a 95% confidence interval accuracy over 26 weeks. Identified the optimal model for capturing trend and seasonality, and making reliable predictions.

#### Classification
Developed a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer, achieving a mean accuracy of 94.9%. Using FDR to reduce false discoveries, key interaction terms significantly improved the model, explaining 98.2% of the variability in diagnosis.

#### MAB (Multi-Armed-Bandits)
Simulated and evaluated traditional A/B/C testing and four MAB strategies (Greedy, Ïµ-Greedy, Softmax, and UCB) to optimize website conversion rates. The UCB strategy achieved the highest conversion rate of 15%, demonstrating superior performance in balancing exploration and exploitation compared to other methods.
